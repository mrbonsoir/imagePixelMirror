# imagePixelMirror

This is a little project all made in Python 2.7.10 and openCV3. After openCV the python module numpy is pretty important to be able to get most of the code here.

I did follow this tutorial  (install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx)[http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/] to get openCV3 to work on my macbook pro. 

In general I can say this website (pyimagesearch)[http://www.pyimagesearch.com/] was full of useful information.

# What does is do?
The code here will simply open a video stream from a webcam. Each frame will be replaced by a mosaic of small images. All the mosaic images are images previously recorded by the program.
